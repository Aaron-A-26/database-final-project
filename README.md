# Database 1 - Final Project

This repository contains files which demonstrate work done on a final project in my Database 1 class in the SP 2020 semester at Florida Polytechnic University.

My team and I were required to analyze the requirements for, design, implement, document and demonstrate a
relational database system that could automate the functions of a fictional sales company with e-commerce.

For more information, please refer to the "Project Requirements.pdf" file.
